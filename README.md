# AnalyzingCustomerChurn_Tableau

Customer Churn Analysis is segment of analysis I have always been intrigued by.

After researching about the topic itself, I decided to get hands-on with it and work on a case study.
I went with the case study present on Data Camp.

With this thorough project, I performed exploratory analysis with Tableau, and went on investigate churn patterns and lastly, concluded with visualizing my analysis.
